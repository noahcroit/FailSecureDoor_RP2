# Access Control Project
The project consists of \
- PCB design and the firmware of `Fail-Secure` door lock for the access control room. \
- Python worker of access control interface. This software will interract with the room management system later \

The project has 2 different version, v2023 and v2024.

## v2023 version
This version was focused on Proof-of-Concept and do a rapid prototype with both HW and SW. Micropython was used for the firmware development in RP2040 as for the Doorlock controller\
ZkTeco's access control was being used in this phase.

## v2024 version (the current ver.) 
PCB design with KiCAD for the doorlock controller. Hikvision's access control is being used in this phase instead of ZkTeco's.
